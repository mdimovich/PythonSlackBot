# Python Slack Bot:
A bot for a Slack Channel named #botpractice

# How To use:
1. Add the bot authentication token from the Slack website to your environment variables
2. Run print_bot_id script to find the bots ID
3. Add BOT_ID to environment variables
4. Make sure you have a public Slack channel open that you invited the bot to
5. Run the main script and access the bot

# Commands:
Here's some of the commands I've added to the bot so far:
 - do list users: Lists all the usernames on your Slack channel
 - do list names: Lists all the real names of the users on the channel
 - do thumbs up: Posts a thumbs up emoji
 - do test: A test command to test the functionalities of chat.postMessage

# To Do:
In the future I want to:
 - Install a series of different functions for the bot to perform
 - Create different chat options for the bot to react to
 - Input equations and the bot posts the answer to the chat
