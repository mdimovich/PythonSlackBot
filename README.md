# PythonSlackBot
A bot for a Slack Channel named #botpractice

# How To use
To use the bot properly, you need to set up bot usage on your slack account. You need to put the authentication token in your environment variables for the bot to work properly. After that, collect the bot id using the print_bot_id script. After that you can run the main script and it should run. 

# ToDo
In the future I want to:
 - Install a series of different functions for the bot to perform
 - Create different chat options for the bot to react to
 - Input equations and the bot posts the answer to the chat
